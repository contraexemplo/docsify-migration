### Can I use Open Collective for free?

You can set up a Collective absolutely free. However, there are fees to accept and spend money. If you want to do crowdfunding, get sponsorship, sell tickets, pay contributors, reimburse expenses, and generate receipts, you need a fiscal host for your collective.

### What is a fiscal host? 

A fiscal host is a legal entity or individual who holds the Collective’s money in their bank account and makes it possible to generate invoices and receipts for backers and sponsors who give the Collective money. You can think of a fiscal host as an umbrella organization for Collectives.

The fiscal host is responsible for taxes, accounting, compliance, and financial admin, like verifying expenses have valid receipts, and paying out money for expenses approved by the Collective’s core contributors. Fiscal hosting enables Collectives to transact financially without needing to legally incorporate. Sometimes this is called “fiscal sponsorship”.

### How much does it cost?

Like most other crowdfunding platforms, Open Collective takes a 5% commission which doesn't include the payment processor fees (Stripe, PayPal).

If you decide to have your a Fiscal Host for your collective, the host may charge an additional commission for managing bookkeeping, taxes, and admin (fiscal sponsorship). For example, the Open Source Collective charges 5% to host open source projects around the world and facilitate invoicing with big tech companies like Facebook, AirBnB, Coinbase, etc. Women Who Code is charging 10% to enable groups of women around the world to create a local Women Who Code Chapter to teach each other how to code. They also provide other services like a job board, events, etc.

These fees vary per host, but they are usually 5%—so 10% all together with the platform fee.
