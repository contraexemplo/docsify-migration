# Core Contributors Guidelines

**Work in the open**. It saves a lot of time. There should be little to no distinction between an internal and external contributor.

**Seek advice** but make your call. Make sure you ping anyone internally or externally that could add valuable feedback to what you are working on.

**Be mindful of everyone else’s time:** don’t block others. Think about how someone can take over from you, don’t become a bottleneck.

**Apply rough consensus**. You don’t need everyone to sign off on something.

**Go ahead**, results speak louder than words.

**Deliver.** Schedules are flexible but…

...**Show up for** \(online\) meetups, let the team know if you can’t make it. Trust by default, don’t break the trust. Don’t lie.

**Support and encourage contributions.** When someone contributes, it means they care.

**Take care of yourself**, it’s a marathon - not a sprint. Take care of each other. We are all doing our best.

Expect **review requests** to be replied in 24h hours \(excluding weekends\), after this period you can merge.

Ensure you have **proper RFCs** for important changes

**You’re responsible** for deploying what you develop

**It’s everyone’s responsibility to make sure we are all as autonomous as possible. To achieve that we use these questions to prioritize what gets done:**

* Does this serve our mission? 
* Will this make us financially sustainable within a year?
* Is it feasible to build and maintain with our team and runway?
* Can this make us move faster?
* Does this increase quality and not technical debt?
* Will this bring us more Collective and financial contributors?
* Is this already solved elsewhere or is it our unique contribution?
* Can we measure the success of  this?
