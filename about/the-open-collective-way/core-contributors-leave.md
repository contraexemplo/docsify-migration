# Core contributors: Leave

**Vacations:**

* 25 days a year, paid
* Unlimited unpaid leave \(make sure everything is organized and anyone can take on your tasks\). Please note we are a startup and on a constrained budget that can change by the time you are back. Over 3 months unpaid leave, we can’t guarantee that we’ll able to pay you again.

**Parental Leave:**

* 25 days paid \(your vacations\)
* 6  months unpaid. Please note that we are a startup that is not sustainable yet and our situation might change but we will strive to pay you again after 6 months of parental unpaid leave.
