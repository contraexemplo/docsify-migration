The engineering team \(Fran√ßois, Ben, Leo, Kate\) started to use a public formula for compensation: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvdgSmFbfB6Cj8vnWm01v7wZmo42QpcSvCK8tgIzDW0/edit\#gid=165029136](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvdgSmFbfB6Cj8vnWm01v7wZmo42QpcSvCK8tgIzDW0/edit#gid=165029136)

In addition to this, every engineer in the team is granted a $100 monthly gift card to contribute to the projects of their choice.
