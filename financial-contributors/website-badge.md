# Website Badge

To show the list of Collectives that you are backing, use this script on your website:

```text
<script src="https://opencollective.com/:username/collectives.js?role=backer"></script>
```

You can replace `backer` by `admin` \(core contributor\), `member` \(contributor\) or `host`. Leave it empty or remove it to show all the collectives that you are a member of, irrespective of the role.
