## The Open Collective Way

#### Mission

We are on a mission to enable communities to be sustainable and fundraise in full transparency without having to create a legal entity to do it.  

#### Values

Sustainability: We can’t achieve our mission unless we are sustainable doing it. We take a broad definition of sustainability as financial, collective and individual sustainability.

Openness: We work in the open, use public slack, our code is public. We strive to be reachable and welcoming.

Resilience \(people come and go\) A successful company survives its founders. We try to do things in a way anyone can pick up after and carry on.

Transparency: Our[ data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1OwRpuIehFQxRnJIRAksQ1Jd2xXZrhz5L) is public as well as[ our revenue numbers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1uNDoafJyI50o128tjV2HjJGrf8l4bGOorJdSL8qgPyk/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=113376999794383062808), our investors update are regularly published[ in our medium](https://medium.com/open-collective) and our salary tiers are published here.

## Core Contributors Guidelines

Work in the open. It saves a lot of time. There should be little to no distinction between an internal and external contributor.

Seek advice but make your call. Make sure you ping anyone internally or externally that could add valuable feedback to what you are working on.

Be mindful of everyone else’s time: don’t block others. Think about how someone can take over from you, don’t become a bottleneck.

Apply rough consensus. You don’t need everyone to sign off on something.

Go ahead, results speak louder than words.

Deliver. Schedules are flexible but…

...Show up for \(online\) meetups, let the team know if you can’t make it. Trust by default, don’t break the trust. 

Don’t lie.

Support and encourage contributions. When someone contributes, it means they care.

Take care of yourself, it’s a marathon - not a sprint. Take care of each other. We are all doing our best.

Expect review requests to be replied in 24h hours \(excluding weekends\), after this period you can merge.

Ensure you have proper RFCs for important changes

You’re responsible for deploying what you develop

It’s everyone’s responsibility to make sure we are all as autonomous as possible. 

## Communication

#### Slack

We use [Slack](http://slack.opencollective.com) to communicate. Make sure you join the appropriate channels for your area \(\#engineering \#design \#internal-support \#support etc\) We try to have most conversations on open channels. We will invite you to the private Team channel which we use for internal conversations.   


Slack is used for our asynchronous standup. We will add you to standuply when you join \(please ping François on slack or [francois@opencollective.com](mailto:francois@opencollective.com) if you are not on it yet\). Every day we answer: 

* What’s your update for today? \(what are you working on / what have you done?\)
* Do you need anything from anyone?

EU/Africa’s deadline is before the standup 3pm CET 

Americas / NZ: deadline is at the end of the day  


Good Practices for Slack: 

* DM if it’s urgent / personal
* Use public channels by default
* Thread replies for ease of flow

#### GitHub

Conversations about features, feedback, bugs, etc must be reported on GitHub. This allows us to properly track them. 

Main Repo: All issues should be posted in the [main repo](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective).

Bugs: We provide a template for bug reporting - Please follow up as much as possible 

Features: Features have a template that starts with the user. For example, As a Collective Admin I want to…

#### Freshdesk

We use Freshdesk to track user support requests. If you receive a support inquiry that can’t be solves immediately \(e.g. on Slack or email\), you can create a Freshdesk ticket for followup. You may be assigned support tickets that relate to projects you’re working on.

#### Weekly Calls

Monday 330pm CEST / 930am EST: Weekly meeting: weekly planning, review of To Dos, numbers and open issues. This is the [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tYVbaQyU1GMk53AfG-w6w60A9A_m6BXCY2zhbHdfNAE/edit) we use to track our weekly goals. 

Tuesday 830am CEST / 830PM NZT:  EU/NZ Weekly Meeting

Friday 3pm CEST / 9am EST: Friday Demo: We present the week’s progress. If you need to make a presentation you can use [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q_XQdgTd3zOgSJTj9CJn1Cr-o8mG-gzA8X1wJ13euWU/edit?usp=sharing)

Monday and Friday calls [are recorded](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MKLkUbht2-nOwSmN8mnjO4c78doVG7NA) for team members who can’t make the time. 

Daily Calls: Tuesday-Thursday 3pm CEST / 9AM EST: daily standup. Rough account of what we are up to & blockers.

## Team Retreats

We organize quarterly Team Retreats to bring the whole team together for 3-4 days. There is an expectation that everyone \(within reason\) participates. If you live very far away from where the retreat takes place, or it’s hard for ou to travel we ask you to try to come at least once a year. 

Design normally sends one member per retreat so they all get a chance to participate. 

We will cover expenses for you to join. Please submit the receipt of your travel to the relevant retreat event on our [Collective.](https://opencollective.com/opencollective) Please try and take the train when possible! If you are coming from far away and the ticket is expensive, please contact Alanna \([alanna@opencollective.com](mailto:alanna@opencollective.com)\) to sort it out. 

You can find previous retreats docs [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1kJGsdlfQS5BjMsTwYEw0UdtHKs5ITU3i).

## Prioritization Framework

To achieve that we use these questions to prioritize what gets done:

* Does this serve our mission?
* Will this make us financially sustainable?
* Is it possible to build and maintain with our team and runway?
* Can this make us move faster?
* Does this increase quality and not technical debt?
* Will this bring us more Collectives and financial contributors?
* Is this already solved elsewhere, or is it our unique contribution?
* Can we measure the success of this?

## Project Templates 

All projects must have an owner, metrics, and a timeframe and must follow these guidelines: 

* Create a Github issue using the Project template
* Bring it up in team meeting and/or host a kickoff workshop
* Link related issues or create Github project

Project owner role

* Facilitator
* tie breaker & decision-maker
* Producer
* makes sure no one’s blocked
* Responsible for delivery
* QA
* Documentation and comms plan
* Pass the role on if they can’t continue
* Post-ship plan for maintenance
