# GitHub Permissions

When connecting your Open Collective account to GitHub you will be asked to grant these permissions:

* Code
* Issues
* Pull Requests
* Wikis
* Settings
* Webhooks services
* Deploy Keys

We recognize that this is asking for a lot of permissions. We looked into it thoroughly, and unfortunately we need all of these permissions for Open Collective functionality to work.

For more details, see the [discussion on the associated issue](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues/355).
