# Testing with Cypress

## Best practices

We should try to stick with [https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html) as much as possible. In short, we should currently enforce:

### Use data-cy to target DOM elements

> Donâ€™t target elements based on CSS attributes such as: id, class, tag Add data-\* attributes to make it easy to target elements

### Tests independence

Tests should not rely on each others results and should be repeatable \(we must be able to run it multiple times consecutively\). You can use commands like `cy.signup()` to ensure that you start from a fresh context.

## Custom commands

To improve the testing experience and the readability of our tests, we have defined a set of custom commands in `cypress/support/commands.js`.

### Login, signup and seeding

Both the `cy.login` and `cy.signup` commands accept a redirect parameter. You can use it to be redirected to a specific page as soon as the command succeed.

{% hint style="info" %}
**`cy.login({email, redirect} = params)`**
{% endhint %}

Login with an existing account. If not provided in `params`, the email used for authentication will be `testuser+admin@opencollective.com`.

Note that addresses formatted like `test*@opencollective.com` are a special case that let you login directly without the need to confirm your email. You can use the `randomEmail` helper to generate these.

{% hint style="info" %}
**`cy.signup({user, redirect} = params)`**
{% endhint %}

Create an account and login with it. If no params is provided, the account will be created with a random email.

{% hint style="info" %}
**`cy.createCollective({ type` = 'ORGANIZATION'`, email =`defaultTestUserEmai**l**`})`**
{% endhint %}

Helper to quickly create a collective that use designated by `email` will be an admin of.

{% hint style="info" %}
**`cy.addCreditCardToCollective({ collectiveSlug })`**
{% endhint %}

Adds a default test credit card to the collective referenced by `collectiveSlug`

### Forms

{% hint style="info" %}
**`cy.fillStripeInput(container, cardParams)`**
{% endhint %}

Fills a stripe input.

* `container` \(optional\) the DOM that contains the input
* `cardParams` \(optional\) the credit card info. Defaults to a valid card. Keys:
  * `creditCardNumber`
  * `expirationDate`
  * `cvcCode`
  * `postalCode`

### Emails

{% hint style="info" %}
**`cy.openEmail(filterFunc)`**
{% endhint %}

This function is used to open an email in Cypress. If the command succeed, a page with the email is loaded and you'll be able to run all the usual cypress commands \(`cy.get`, `cy.contains`...\) to test it.

* `fiterFunc` is a function used to filter the list of email. As soon as it returns `true`, command will start to open the email. For a complete list of the fields you can use to filter the email, see [https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev/blob/master/docs/rest.md](https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev/blob/master/docs/rest.md) 

**Examples**

```javascript
// Will open the first email with where subject contains "Hello World"
cy.openEmail(({ subject }) => subject.includes('Hello World'));

// Will open the first email sent to `test@email.com`
cy.openEmail(({ to }) => to[0].address === 'test@email.com' );
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**`cy.getInbox()`**
{% endhint %}

Return the full inbox as a list of [email objects](https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev/blob/master/docs/rest.md#example-email-response). `cy.openEmail` should be privileged, but this one can be useful if you need to do more advanced verification like counting the number of emails or who the email was sent to.

```javascript
> cy.getInbox()

  }
}]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**`cy.clearInbox()`**
{% endhint %}

Clears the inbox. It is a good practice to run it in `before` to ensure that your test cannot be influenced by the emails sent in previous tests.
