# Architecture

## Collectives

In Open Collective, every entity is a collective and can be accessed publicly via their unique slug `https://opencollective.com/:slug`.

A Collective can be of type:

* **COLLECTIVE** e.g. [Webpack](https://opencollective.com/webpack)
* **EVENT** e.g. [BrusselsTogether Meetup 4](https://opencollective.com/brussels/together/events/meetup-4)
* **ORGANIZATION** e.g. [iDoneThis](https://opencollective.com/idonethis), [DigitalOcean](https://opencollective.com/digitalocean), etc.
* **USER** e.g. [xdamman](https://opencollective.com/xdamman)

## Members

A Member connects a User to a Collective. It can have multiple roles \(one role per row\):

* **HOST** legal holder of the bank account that holds the money on behalf of the collective
* **ADMIN** users who can approve expenses for the collective \(aka core contributors\)
* **MEMBER** aka contributors
* **BACKER** users who gave money to the collective
* **FOLLOWER** used atm for users interested in an event collective

## Orders

An Order is the intent to give or withdraw money from a Collective. It is created by a UserId on behalf of a collective \(which can be their own UserCollective or any other Collective that they are a member of\).

Attributes:

| Attribute | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| type | type of order | EXPENSE\|DONATION |
| UserCollectiveId | User who created the order | /xdamman |
| FromCollectiveId | Source of the money | /digitalocean |
| ToCollectiveId | Destination of the money | /webpack |
| currency | currency of the ToCollectiveId | USD |
| amount | amount in cents | 10000 |
| SubscriptionId | References recurring subscription |  |
| status | status of the order | PENDING -&gt; APPROVED\|REJECTED -&gt; PAID |

## Transactions

A Transaction records money moving from one Collective to another Collective. In this example, a collective [webpack](https://opencollective.com/webpack) is giving €100 to [Women Who Code Berlin](https://opencollective.com/wwcodeberlin) hosted by [Women Who Code 501\(c\)\(3\)](https://opencollective.com/wwcode).

| Attribute | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| OrderId | References the order | 1 |
| FromCollectiveId | Source of the money \(virtual account\) | /webpack |
| ToCollectiveId | Destination of the money \(virtual account\) | /wwcodeberlin |
| PaymentMethodId | Payment method \(e.g. if there wasn't enough funds in the `FromCollectiveId`\) | `NULL` |
| FromHostId | Source of the money | /opensource |
| ToHostId | Destination of the money | /wwcode |
| FromHostAmount | total amount in cents paid by the host of the `FromCollectiveId` in the currency of the host | -11481 \(-$114.81\) |
| FromCollectiveAmount | total amount that increases/decreases the balance of the `FromCollectiveId` in the currency of the FromCollectiveId | -11481 |
| paymentProcessorFeesInHostCurrency | fees for the payment processor in cents |  |
| hostFeesInHostCurrency | fees for the host in cents in the currency of the host \(which might be different than the currency of the collective, e.g. WWCode \(USD\) and WWCode Berlin \(EUR\) | 574 \(5% of €100 in USD\) |
| platformFeesInHostCurrency | fees for the platform \(Open Collective\) | 574 \(5% of €100 in USD\) |
| ToHostAmount | net amount in cents received by the host of the `ToCollectiveId` in the currency of the `ToHostId` | 9630 \(€100 - \(2.9% + $0.30\) - €5 platform fee\) |
| ToCollectiveAmount | total amount that increases/decreases the balance of the `ToCollectiveId` in the currency of the order | 9580 \(€96.30 - €5 host fee\) |
| FromHostCurrency | currency of the `FromHostId` | USD |
| FromCollectiveCurrency | currency of the `FromCollectiveId` | USD |
| ToCollectiveCurrency | currency of the collective that receives the money | EUR |
| ToHostCurrency | currency of the order \(currency of the `ToCollectiveId`\) | USD |
| fxrate | Foreign eXchange Rate from the currency of the order \(`ToCollectiveCurrency`\) to the currency of the host of the `FromCollectiveId` \(float\) | 1.15 |

Note: The Collective currency might be different than the Host Currency \(both for the source "From" and the recipient "To"\). The fxrate only takes into account the conversion between `ToCollectiveCurrency` to `ToHostId`.
