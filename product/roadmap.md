# Roadmap

### Open Collective Roadmap: May - June \(short Q2\)

This \(short\) Quarter is all about shedding complexity: in our offer, in our codebase, in our UI.

Offer:  
 Covid has given us an opportunity to position ourselves in a new vertical that has similar requirements than the Open Source one. Crisis Responders. I mean similar in the sense that they need a turn-key solution that includes a platform to fundraise and disburse funds paired with a fiscal host that can act as the custodian of the funds. We’ve struggled to replicate this outside of the FOSS ecosystem, but now we are seeing it again.

To make sure we support as many groups as possible in this vertical, we’ve waived our fees until June, we are hiring someone to manage the Open Collective Foundation \(501c3 that’s doing the fiscal hosting in the US\) and relaunched it with a focus on COVID. From the new collectives in march 175 are COVID related initiatives.

The growth driven by COVID-19 Relief groups is an opportunity for us to focus our efforts on growing a new segment of collectives with a **First Party Host** \(this is a host we own, as opposed to a third party host, a legal entity that uses Open Collective Platform\). This is important for us, because we are providing a complete solution ourselves: Tax deductible fiscal sponsorship as a service paired with a transparent open finances platform.

### PayPal Payout API Upgrade

We're currently using [Paypal Adaptive Payments](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/adaptive-payments/integration-guide/APIntro)  
 PayPal introduced a Payout API that provides the following benefits over adaptive payments:  
 Payout limit is $20,000 USD  
 For payouts made through the API, it’s just $0.25 USD per U.S. transaction.  
 For international payments, the fee is 2% of the payment amount to each recipient \(up to a maximum of $20\)

## **Key questions for prioritization**

**This is what we ask ourselves to decide what gets done and what doesn't.**

* Does this serve our mission? 
* Will this make us financially sustainable within a year?
* Is it feasible to build and maintain with our team and runway?
* Can this make us move faster?
* Does this increase quality and not technical debt?
* Will this bring us more Collective and financial contributors?
* Is this already solved elsewhere or is it our unique contribution?
* Can we measure the success of  this?

## Template for new projects

* Github issue
  * explain the feature. 
  * Link to other opened issues or data. 
  * Include details below.
* Kickoff
  * Organize a special meeting or on a scheduled one. 
* Project owner. 
  * Role: Facilitator, decision-maker, producer. 
  * It's ultimately responsible for \(needs to do or organize who does\)
    * Delivery 
    * Q&A
    * Docs & Comms 
    * Post-ship plan for maintenance 
* Success metric\(s\)
* Timeframe - kickoff and delivery, main milestones / roadmap
