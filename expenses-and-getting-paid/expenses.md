## FAQ

### How do I get paid from a Collective?

Go to the Collective and click "Submit Expense". You will need to upload a valid receipt or provide invoicing details, and input your PayPal address or bank account.

### How are expenses approved?

Anyone can file an expense to any Collective. To be paid, it must be approved by one of the Admins of that Collective.

Please ensure your expense meets the expense policy of the Collective, which appears on the 'submit expense' page. If you modify an expense, it will have to be approved again. 

### Are receipts or invoices public?

Basic data for all expenses, like the amount and description, are public. But attachments, payment details, addresses, and comments are private, as they may contain personal information. Only the Admins and the submitter can see full expense details.

### When will I get paid?

Expenses for Collectives in [Fiscal Hosts](../fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts.md) managed by Open Collective are paid weekly, on Thursdays. Other hosts have their own policies and schedules.

### By what method can I get paid?

Right now our system can process outgoing payments to Paypal addresses and bank accounts \(in countries served by Transferwise\).

Paying by other means is a manual process at the discretion of the Fiscal Host. If you are not able to use Paypal or bank account payments through Transferwise, get in touch with the fiscal host of the Collective and see what other options might be available.
