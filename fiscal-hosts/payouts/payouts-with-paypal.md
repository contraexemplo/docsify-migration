# Payouts with PayPal

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is currently in **Beta** test, read more about it [here](payouts-with-paypal.md#the-beta-test).
{% endhint %}

For hosts that are using PayPal, this integration can be used to automate expense payment by providing a one-click solution for paying expenses using [PayPal Payouts](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/payouts/).

After connecting your PayPal account, you'll be able to schedule expenses submitted using PayPal as a payout method for mass-payout without needing to reauthorize with PayPal every $2,000 USD. Expenses scheduled for payout also have a higher limit \(up to $20,000 per expense\) and cheaper fees, you can schedule expenses for payout up to your existing PayPal balance.

## Fees

#### What are the fees involved?

The fees are charged by PayPal and its value will vary with the currencies being and value being transferred. You can read more about it [here](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/payouts/reference/fees/).

#### Who pays for the fees?

These fees are paid by the collective the expense was submitted for. This means that transactions in PayPal will display the fees but that value will also be deducted from the collective balance in our platform as _payment processor fee_.

## How does it work?

The new payment process is asynchronous, meaning that expenses are now scheduled for payout and dealt with by a scheduled worker. This worker runs once every hour, this means that on the turn of the clock we'll bundle the scheduled expenses and pay them in a single request to PayPal.

After being proccessed by the worker, the expense is marked as in _**Processing**_ and individualy tracked. We'll make sure its status is up-to-date on our platform, bear in mind that in the case the recipient doesn't have a PayPal account, they have up to 30 days to create and accept the payment.

If the payment is successful, the expense is marked as _**Paid**_, and in case something goes wrong during this process the expense will be marked as _**Error**_ so you can try it again or process it manually.

## Reducing Risks

In order to reduce risks related to having an active API token that is able to create and fund transactions, we strongly suggest you to:

1. Keep just enough balance in PayPal to pay your expenses.
   * This can be achieved by calculating the amount needed for the current payment cycle and transferring it beforehand.
