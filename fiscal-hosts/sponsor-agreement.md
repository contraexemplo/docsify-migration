## Sponsorship Agreement Template

Some Collectives form sponsorship relationships for which an agreement can make everything more clear and secure for all parties.

We have developed this template for Collectives in Fiscal Hosts in the United States, but it may be useful for others.

The entity forming a legal agreement with the sponsor is your [Fiscal Host](fiscal-hosts.md). Therefore, Collectives need someone from their fiscal host involved, and cannot enter into legal agreements on their own, as they are not an incorporated entity.

## Open Collective Terms Host Addendum

When a Fiscal Host signs up with Open Collective, we provide this addendum to the standard terms and conditions to cover the extended services and relationship.
