In this section, you can control the visibility and the order of all sections of your profile page.

To change the visibility of a specific section, use the dropdown menu to change its state to either **Always visible** or **Disabled**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your data is preserved when you hide a section and you'll be able to re-enable it whenever you want. If hidden, the section will be hidden for everyone — including you — and you will not be able to edit it.
{% endhint %}
