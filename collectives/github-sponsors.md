# Setting up GitHub Sponsors

**This document is a guide to connecting Github Sponsors for Organizations to your Collective. This option is currently only available for Collectives fiscally hosted by the Open Source Collective, which will hold the funds on behalf of your project.**

_Note: Transaction data about the funds you receive through GitHub Sponsors will be shared with Open Source Collective in order to credit your budget._

Open Source projects can use Open Collective to receive GitHub Sponsors funds by following these steps:

1. Confirm that you have a **GitHub organization** \(not an individual user account\). You can create a GitHub organization by following [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch). 
2. [Create a Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource/apply) for your open source project if you don't already have one. 
3. Visit [github.com/sponsors](http://github.com/sponsors) and sign your Github organization up for the Sponsors waitlist.  ‚úîÔ∏è Select: "This organization is using a Fiscal Sponsor" and select Open Collective from the menu.  ‚úîÔ∏è For non-profit status, answer: ‚ÄúYes, this organization has nonprofit status but cannot receive tax-deductible donations from individuals \(e.g., 501c6\)‚Äù 
4. GitHub staff will review your application, and you'll be notified when you can proceed to the next step.

## Setting up Stripe Connect

Once your application has been approved by GitHub, you need to connect Stripe. To link to your Collective, you need to get connected to Open Source Collective's Stripe account by following the below steps.

When you first click on the Stripe Connect account link, you will be taken to a Stripe sign up page.

### Country of operation and contact information

You will be asked to select the country where you legally operate from, or receive payouts in. As Open Source Collective is a US entity, select **United States**.

You may enter your own phone number, which will be used to verify the account. Use an email accessible to the person in your project responsible for sponsorship activities, for Stripe Connect updates.
