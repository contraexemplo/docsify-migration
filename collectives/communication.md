# Updates & Comms

## Updates to Financial Contributors

A lot of Collectives like to periodically email their Financial Contributors, to let them know what their donations are enabling, express thanks, or notify everyone of a change.

To create an Update, go to your Collective page, head to the **Updates** section and click on **+ Create a new update**.

You can also write and publish Updates through email by sending a message to **backers@`$COLLECTIVE`.opencollective.com** \(in which `$COLLECTIVE` is the slug of your Collective, which appears in your Collective URL.
{% endhint %}

Updates will be emailed and appear in the Updates section of your Collective page.

## Contacting a Collective

Users can contact you via the contact form of your collective. It is linked in your collective page through the `Contact` button. The forms stands on `/{your-collective}/contact`. If you don't want to use this feature, please email us at `support@opencollective.com` and we'll disable it for you.
